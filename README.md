## Objective
For the University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp final project, our team created a full stack MERN application to demonstrate the skills we have learned during the 12 weeks of the bootcamp. It was originally named Fitness Tracker. Since completing the bootcamp, the app has been renamed to Workout Placita with additional features ongoing.

## Description

The idea for this applicationw as born out of practicality. I wanted a way to record my personal thoughts about a specific video workout so that I could easily find it in the future and either share or redo the workout (or both!). The platform I was using only had a simple bookmarking option, but no way to indicate why I bookmarked the app. With generic workout names (20 min Yoga Flow, 10 min Empathy Meditation, 30 90s Ride), it required scrolling and guessing and luck to find previously enjoyed workouts. I also wasn't looking for another way to track my activity - more my experience.

Meet Workout Placita.

Placita is Latin for opinions. Workout Placita allows you to record your person opinions or notes about your workout, and then access and share that information in the future. You simply create your own personal workout profile. Once within your profile, you are able to make a record of your workout, including the name, URL link, and (most importantly!) your thoughts. 

Placita is Spanish for little plaza. Workout Placita is also a gathering place for you to connect with your friends and view their workout opinions as well. You can read their workout thoughts and make your own comments, creating a conversation about that specific workout.
